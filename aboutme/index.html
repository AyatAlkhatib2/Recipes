    <h1>Welcome to Ayat's CookBook Recipes</h1>
       
        <main>

          <p>Welcome to my corner of the web, where I share simple, no-fuss recipes that I’ve learned over time. Cooking doesn’t have to be complicated, and that’s the philosophy behind every dish here. My recipes are designed to be easy, straightforward, and perfect for anyone looking to make delicious meals without the stress.</p>

          <p>This website originally started as a personal project—to motivate myself to cook more, share my favorite recipes, and have a space to explore my love of web development. It's been a fun journey of learning and creativity.</p>
  
          <p>Along the way, I’ve dreamed of opening a cozy café with a small bookstore—a space that blends my passion for food and reading. While I’m not a professional chef, this project allows me to experiment with my skills and share what I love. Every recipe is a step toward turning that dream into reality.</p>
  
          <p>Thank you for joining me on this journey! I hope these simple dishes inspire you to cook, explore, and create.</p>
          <p> main career. This website is part of that journey. While I'm not a professional chef, this project was created for enjoyment and as a way to experiment with my skills.</p>
