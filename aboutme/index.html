        <p>Hello, my name is Ayat Alkhatib. I created this website to share the simple recipes I've learned over time. None of the recipes are complicated—just easy and straightforward dishes. This website was originally made for personal reasons: to motivate myself to cook more and share recipes, while also providing a space to explore and build personal web projects for fun. I wanted to showcase my skills in a creative and enjoyable way.

            My dream is to open a small café with a bookstore, as a fun side business alongside my main career. This website is part of that journey. While I'm not a professional chef, this project was created for enjoyment and as a way to experiment with my skills.</p>
