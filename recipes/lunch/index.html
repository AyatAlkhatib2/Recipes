    <h1>Lunches</h1>
    <p>Growing up, our main meal of the day was lunch. When we moved to America, I realized that lunch here isn't considered the main course; it's usually something small and simple. This sparked my interest in exploring the variety of lunch items I saw people eating, and I began to compare them with the traditional foods of my Arab culture. I was curious about how different foods could complement each other, even though Arabic cuisine is often centered around meat, rice, soup, and bread. Learning about other cultural foods has been a wonderful experience.</p>
